    <h1>About Tarot Fabula</h1>
    <h2>a shuffled capstone project of tarot card symbolism, story serendipity, and playful potentiality</h2>
  </div>
<div class="about-container">
    <p class="about-card">Tarot Fabula was created  in fulfillment of an MA in Digital Humanities at The Graduate Center @ CUNY's fall semester, 2023-2024. This is a research project and website that examines the digital tarot card deck as a unique narrative form, using the digital archives of card decks out of their original context to define and reshape meaning, playfully.</p> 
    <p class="about-card">Statistically random reshufflings of tarot decks from archival collections prompt the reader to become a narrative co-creator, drawing them into conversation with traditional reading and interpretive practices as they remix narrative elements portrayed on the cards.</p> 
    <p class="about-card">In Tarot Fabula, randomness is both designed and has limitations, utilizing a programmatic solution like the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm to shuffle through a limited number of several cards with different designs and similar values.</p> 
    <p class="about-card">This project emerged in an era marked by machine learning algorithms, search engines, media recommendation tools, and targeted consumer personalization, which all utilize some controlled and hidden computational determinant. The Tarot Fabula set upends the expectations of an experienced tarot user plainly though it too is using a hidden mechanism to choose its results. </p> 
    <p class="about-card">Since their earliest recorded use in the 1400s, tarot cards figure as objects for game play, artistic creativity, spiritual divination, and self-discovery. Tarot Fabula introduces a ludic, interactive website interface that challenges 20th century tarot reading practices as linear narratives. </p>
    <p class="about-card">Drawing on values of minimal computing to support accessibility and sustainability, Tarot Fabula deploys traditional front-end languages (HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript), and one open source JS library  <a href="https://micromodal.vercel.app/">(Micromodal.JS)</a>. </p>
    <p class="about-card">Tarot Fabula’s shuffling and reshuffling of cards as historical objects merges contemporary computational methods for generating random results with an interrogation of traditional assumptions of reading, interpreting, and storytelling. </p>
    <p class="about-card">The cards present a mirror that calls attention to the limitations of linear narrative and the opportunities for storytelling we encounter as citizens of an algorithmic age. </p>
    <p class="about-card">In Tarot Fabula, we look to the tarot system's rich past in order to better design our own stories of the future, in the present's era of algorithms and unreliable information. With inspiration from Muñoz's Cruising Utopia and Burgess's Radical Tarot, Tarot Fabula offers a new lens of reading the cards to create and expand narrative potentiality in service of meaning-making.</p>
    <!-- <p class="about-card">The tarot system has been remediated over more than six centuries and still maintains its
      underlying symbols and structure. In a time of rapidly evolving technologies on rapidly evolving
      media, and the several memetic occurrences of text, image, and system in these evolutions, the
      tarot is a lesson in intrinsic survival. Tarot Fabula as a project impacts both the meaning of the
      cards and their context to an interacting user, and the creation of new meaning and significance
      to archived cards to the present-day context. By building the data set of disparate cards in a
      focused subset, it was easier to build connections between the cards’ familiar iconography.
      Though the visual information presented on the cards developed further meaning over time, from
      game, to spiritual divinatory practice to its many uses today, the tarot remains as a recognizable
      system through its evolution. While Tarot Fabula is a narrative tool, the attempt to remediate the
      cards to be a tool of radical potentiality emerged by viewing these throughlines and imagining
      the usage of these cards in the future. To that end, the materials used to create Tarot Fabula are
      21
      intentionally meant to sustain the inevitable changes in web browsers and technologies, to ensure
      it can be reused and returned to in the future. Perhaps the future of Tarot Fabula is in another
      querant’s hands, one who may see a potential to remediate the mechanics as I did with the card
      archive as well. Building the scaffolding and scouring the archive created an opportunity to “be
      attentive to the past for the purposes of critiquing a present.” (Muñoz 18) </p> -->
