    <h1>About Tarot Fabula</h1>
    <h2>a capstone project examining tarot card symbolism, randomness and the card shuffle mechanic, and remediation of a reader's narrative expectations</h2>
    <p>Rachel Dixon is a graduate student at The Graduate Center, CUNY. This project is in fulfillment of an MA in Digital Humanities.</p>
    <p>WALL OF TEXT HERE TO BE STYLED SOONTarot Fabula is a research project and website that examines the digital tarot card deck as a unique narrative form, using the digital archives of card decks out of their original context to define and reshape meaning. Tarot Fabula interrogates the pattern of digital applications that provide similar card interactions (such as shuffling and card presentation) that mimic the interactions of using a physical tarot card deck, and interrogates the meaning-making created by randomness. In Tarot Fabula, randomness is designed and has limitations, utilizing a programmatic solution like the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm to shuffle through a limited number of several cards with different designs and similar values. In thinking about how machine learning algorithms, search engines, media recommendation tools, and consumer “personalization” of advertisements all utilize some sense of controlled mechanical randomness, a project like Tarot Fabula lays bare its cards: This set upends the expectations of an experienced tarot user. The Tarot Fabula project asks if the explicit digital shuffling of a dataset of card images feels different than hands shuffling a 78-card deck. 
      I interrogated this with an assumption of what tarot readings can appear to do: by providing the images in a certain presentation, can random cards tell a tarot querant a story? Can the story presented to the querant by the cards as presented change when using different tarot decks, multiple cards, other pattern-breaking surprises? Can viewing a unique reading like this create new meanings for previously-understood archetypes presented in some tarot images, and does this open up more narrative possibilities? Can the mechanic that is presented as randomness itself be trusted? 
      This project addresses several questions I encountered during my studies: How does an algorithmic randomness influence narrative and play? Does a digital database provide an opinion on its contents if it impacts the algorithm driving said randomness?  What purpose does linearity play in displaying digital experiences and their subjects? How do images and metadata deliver meaning when presented together on digital screens (as in archives and collections), and how does that presentation differ from the analog experience? How is the archival view of words & images together on a digital screen different from those encountered during interactive play? What is the import between the space created between the reader and the operant when the reader is a computer? Can a dataset or archive have an unreliable narrator?
