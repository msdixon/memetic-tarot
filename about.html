    <h1>About Tarot Fabula</h1>
    <h2>a capstone project examining tarot card symbolism, story serendipity, and playful potentiality, shuffled</h2>
  </div>
<div class="about-container">
    <p class="about-card">Tarot Fabula was created  in fulfillment of an MA in Digital Humanities at The Graduate Center @ CUNY. This is a research project and website that examines the digital tarot card deck as a unique narrative form, using the digital archives of card decks out of their original context to define and reshape meaning, playfully.</p> 
    <p class="about-card"">Tarot Fabula interrogates the pattern of digital applications that provide interactions (such as shuffling and card presentation) that mimic the interactions of using a physical tarot card deck, and interrogates the meaning-making created by randomness. </p> 
    <p class="about-card"">In Tarot Fabula, randomness is designed and has limitations, utilizing a programmatic solution like the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm to shuffle through a limited number of several cards with different designs and similar values.</p> 
    <p class="about-card"">In thinking about how machine learning algorithms, search engines, media recommendation tools, and consumer “personalization” of advertisements all utilize some sense of controlled mechanical randomness, a project like Tarot Fabula lays its cards bare: This set upends the expectations of an experienced tarot user though it is using a hidden mechanism to choose cards. </p> 
    <p class="about-card"> The Tarot Fabula project asks if the explicit digital shuffling of a dataset of card images feels different than hands shuffling a 78-card deck. </p>
    <p class="about-card"">I interrogated this with an assumption of what tarot readings can appear to do: by providing the images in a certain presentation, can random cards tell a tarot querant a story? </p>
    <p class="about-card"">Can the story presented to the querant by the cards as presented change when using different tarot decks, multiple cards, other pattern-breaking surprises? Can viewing a unique reading like this create new meanings for previously-understood archetypes presented in some tarot images, and does this open up more narrative possibilities? Can the mechanic that is presented as randomness itself be trusted? </p>
    <p class="about-card"">Importantly, Tarot Fabula is a practice in expansive possibilities, in the potentiality that is otherwise lost to linear narratives, ordered decks, rigid design, querying fate. 
    </p>
      <p class="about-card"">In Tarot Fabula, we look to the tarot system's rich past in order to better design our own stories of the future, in the present's era of algorithms and unreliable information.</p>
